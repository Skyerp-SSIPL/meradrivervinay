<h5 class="mt-15">Coronavirus Covid-19 GRE Exam Alert: GRE® General Test at home during COVID -19</h5>
<p>In response to the ongoing pandemic COVID-19, ETS - the conducting body of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) has decided to launch the GRE® General Test at home for locations where the computer-based format of the GRE Test was earlier available for the convenience of students wanting to study abroad.

The GRE® General Test home edition has been started in response to GRE Test Centres being shut due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;However, candidates need to make sure that they meet the system equipment requirements set by ETS for registration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ETS has a series of webinars available on its official website that familiarizes the candidates with this new feature. The home edition of the GRE test would be available to students until test centers resume functioning in full capacity in the various countries. The GRE scores would be communicated to the student within 10-15 days. Candidates should keep in mind that due to the ongoing pandemic there would be no hard copy of the scorecard available to the student.</p>
<p>There have been many security measures including Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and live proctors, that have been adopted by ETS for the smooth functioning of the test at home. Accommodation for test-takers with a disability is also available to students who require the same and on request. No other major changes have been brought in by the ETS while conducting the GRE test at home. Candidates are requested to visit the official website for a detailed understanding of the same. ETS has also temporarily waived off rescheduling fees for all the test takers owing to the current crisis.</p>

													<div><p>Writing the GRE exam can be stressful given the duration and length of the question paper. Hence, all the&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/gre/gre-test-centres-in-india" target="_blank">coaching institutes</a> teach their students&nbsp;a few&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/gre/preparation-tips" target="_blank">prep tips</a> to save time such as quick calculations, finger-tip formulas, and time management. The most significant learning here is time management that only comes through the rigorous practice of&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/gre/sample-papers" target="_blank">sample papers</a> and mock tests. Even though one is aware of the&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/gre/syllabus" target="_blank">GRE Syllabus</a> and knows all the answers, failure to management time can lead to an incomplete exam. This is where the importance of being familiar with the GRE Exam pattern is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>The GRE question paper is divided into three main sections, namely, Analytical Writing, Verbal Reasoning, and Quantitative Reasoning. The total time given to complete the exam is three&nbsp;hours&nbsp;and thirty minutes (3 hours 30 minutes=210 mins) and for computer-based, it is three hours and forty minutes (3 hours 40 minutes= 220 mins).</p>
<h2>GRE Paper-based Exam Pattern</h2>
<p>The paper-based exam includes two sub-sections of each of the main categories- Analytical Writing, Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning. Analytical Writing part contains two tasks with a duration of one hour (60 mins). Verbal and Quantitative reasoning each contains two sections and 50 questions with a maximum time limit of 60 and 70 minutes, consequently. The variable sections of Unscored and Research are not included in the paper-based exam.</p></div>

<div><h2>GRE Computer-based Exam Pattern</h2>
<p>For the computer-based pattern, each of these sections is further divided into two-sub-sections with forty questions in total (Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning). Analytical Writing has only one section that contains two tasks with a time duration of one hour. Apart from these main sections, there are two other variable sections included in the computer-based pattern exam. This section is followed by a ten-minute break after the Quantitative Reasoning part is complete. However, these two variable sections- Unscored and Research section- are not included in the final GRE Scores.</p>
<p>While the GRE Pattern may change from time to time generally, the crux of the format remains the same. Currently, the following is the exam pattern which aspirants can look forward to:</p>

What can you do now to ensure you get the best score before your exam?

<h4>Effective GRE Preparation Strategies</h4>
<p>Section-wise Preparation Tips for GRE: The first section on the GRE is always the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) section. This section comprises two analytical writing tasks -- an analysis of an issue task and an analysis of an argument task. These two tasks are timed separately and you get 30 minutes to complete each task. This section is followed by two Verbal Reasoning sections, two Quantitative Reasoning sections, and an unidentified unscored section which may be either a&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/gre/prep-tips-verbal-reasoning-section" target="_blank">Verbal Reasoning section</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/gre/prep-tips-quantitative-section" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning section</a>.</p>
<p>These five sections may appear in any order after the&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/gre/prep-tips-analytical-writing" target="_blank">Analytical Writing section</a>. You may also get an identified Research section in place of the unidentified unscored section, and, in that case, the Research section will always appear at the end of the test.

An engineering student will need higher marks in the Quantitative section and arts and humanities students will need higher marks in the Verbal section. Before starting with a preparation strategy, you need to identify what is a good GRE score for your program. Here is a table which will give you a rough idea about good scores which are subject averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Computer-based Test –</strong>&nbsp;Across all sections, all questions contribute equally to the total score. At the end of the test, a raw test score is computed. The raw test score is the number of questions you answered correctly. Through a process called equating, which takes into account the difficulty of the questions, the raw scores for both the sections are converted into scaled scores on the 130–170 scale. Both the Verbal and the Quantitative portions of the exam are section adaptive, meaning that a student's performance on the first section of a type determines how difficult the second section of that type will be. The better a student performs in the first section, the more difficult the second section will be. Answering difficult questions correctly increases the chances of a higher exam score.</p></div>
