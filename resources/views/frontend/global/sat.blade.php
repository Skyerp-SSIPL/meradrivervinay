<h4>Study Material - Books</h4>
<p>It is said that the <a href="#">New SAT could be more difficult for international students: The Princeton Review AVP</a>. With these changes, your preparation for the old SAT would not prove to be of any help in the new SAT. The existing sample papers or practice tests available in the random websites throughout the internet may not be authentic and latest. It is recommended to refer the official SAT practice tests from the official website:</p>

						   <div><p>Understanding SAT Scores might prove to be a tough task for candidates. The overall SAT test is scored on a scale of 400-1600, whereas in India, students are used to understanding scores in percentiles. That is why having a data table for interpreting SAT and Subject Test scores becomes necessary. Here is how the SAT score percentile is calculated.</p>

<h4>SAT Score</h4>
<p>SAT score reports consist of the following information</p>
<ul>
<li>The Total Score: As the title suggests, the Total Score is the sum of the two Section Scores and this score ranges from 400 to 1600.</li>
<li>Sectional Score: The sectional score ranges from 200-800 and is based on the performance of the candidate on the Math Section and Evidence-Based Reading &amp; Writing Sections.</li>
<li>Subscore (marks scored in each type of question): Subscores are multiple points for Reading, Writing and Language, and Math Sections, all ranging from 1 to 15. The main purpose of Sub scores is to provide additional insight into the students' performance.</li>
<li>Essay score (if applicable): Candidates who have undertaken the SAT with the essay will have the scores for Essay Reading (2-8 points), Essay Writing (2-8 points) and Essay Analysis (2-8 points) displayed under the Essay Details tab.</li>
<li>Student's percentile: The student's percentile score tells you how well the student has performed his SAT exam as compared to other test takers.&nbsp;</li>

<h4>SAT Subject Test Percentiles</h4>
<p>As the term suggests, SAT Subject Test Percentile ranks compare a student's scores to other students who appeared for the same test. So for example, if a test takers SAT Math 2 Subject Test score is 500 and if the percentile rank for 500 is 50, then this basically means that the candidate has done better than 50 percent of the students who took the particular test, i.e. SAT Math 2 Subject Test.</p>
<p>Since a different percentage of students take the different subject exams under SAT Subject Tests, hence it would be technically incorrect to compare the SAT Subject Test Chemistry Percentile with SAT Subject Test Math 2 Percentile or vice versa. Candidates looking to see how they have fared in the SAT Subject Test with other candidates can check out SAT Subject Test Percentiles 2019 and for other past years on the official CollegeBoard website – the conducting body of the SAT exam.</p>

<h4>How to check the SAT score?</h4>
<p>Candidates can access the SAT score report on their College Board profile.</p>
<p>Steps to check SAT scores</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1- Visit the College Board's site</li>
<li>Step 2- Sign in using your ID and password</li>
<li>Step 3- Click on My Organiser and go to SAT scores</li>
<li>Step 4- Click on Access My Scores and enter your username and password</li>
<li>Step 5- Go to My Test Scores</li>
<li>Step 6- Your SAT scores will appear on the screen</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidates can send their score reports to the colleges using Score Choice.</p>
<h4>How to Get SAT and Subject Test Scores</h4>
<p>Once you are finished with the SAT exam, it is time to send exam scores to the colleges. This is one of the most crucial parts of the whole application process. Most colleges prefer to get the score reports directly from the College Board and not the copies of the report or score report labels on the transcripts.</p>
<h3><strong>When to Expect Scores</strong></h3>
<p>Your SAT score result will be available online around 4-5 weeks after your test date. Once the score result is available, the College Board begins sending SAT score reports to the colleges the candidate has selected, if any, at the time of registration.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways to Get Scores</strong></h3>
<p>Students who don't have easy access to the Internet can check out alternative methods of receiving their SAT Score, these include</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper Score Reports: Candidates who register by mail and don't have an active College Board online accounts will receive paper score reports.</li>
<li>Scores by phone: Candidates can also receive their scores over the phone. However, they would be required to pay an extra fee for the same.</li>
<li>Candidates can also access their scores by logging into their online score report and taking a print out of the same.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What is Score Choice</strong></h3>
<p>With Score Choice, one gets the freedom to report the score he/she chooses to send to colleges. The candidate can choose the score report by test date or by individual test for SAT Subject Tests. However, before sending the scores always make sure to check with the college or the scholarship program where you are applying, as many colleges and scholarship programs require students to send all their scores. If the candidate doesn't select Score Choice then College Board will send all the available scores of the candidate to the colleges which he/she has selected as score recipients.</p>
<h3><strong>How to send Scores during Registration?</strong></h3>
<p>Applicants receive four free score reports while&nbsp;<a href="#">registering for the SAT exam</a>. &nbsp;Applicants get the option of sending these reports to their choice of colleges or scholarship programs for free. Aspirants can send the scores up to nine days of taking the test. After nine days they will be charged for sending the score reports. With this, the aspirant can send four reports for free. However, there is a catch, the aspirants are sending the scores without knowing their actual scores. This means, the candidates won't be able to choose the score they want to send or they won't be able to send their best scores. In this case, it is advisable to send the score reports to the colleges that want to see all the&nbsp;
<a href="#">SAT</a>&nbsp;scores of the candidates.</p>
