                                                    <div><p><strong>IELTS</strong>&nbsp;is an English language exam that is required to be taken by international candidates considering studying or working in a country where English is the main language of communication. Most popular countries where IELTS is accepted for university admissions are the UK,&nbsp;Australia,&nbsp;New Zealand,&nbsp;USA, and&nbsp;Canada. The exam mainly measures the ability of test-takers to communicate in the four basic English language skills â€“ listening, reading, speaking, and writing. IELTS exam is jointly owned and conducted by IDP Education Australia, British Council, and Cambridge English Language Assessment.&nbsp;With the number of IELTS tests grew to a record of 3.5 million in the year 2018, it has become a leader in the area of international higher education. It is accepted in 100% of universities in the UK and Australia. Also, it is accepted in more than 3,400 institutions in the US and thousands of institutions in English speaking countries.</p>


													<h4>Recent updates in IELTS</h4>
													<p><strong>IELTS Test Fee Update:</strong>&nbsp;IELTS Test fee is being revised to INR 14,000 for registrations from 1st-April-2020.</p>
													<p><strong>CORONAVIRUS ALERT:</strong>&nbsp;IELTS Partners has also launched the IELTS Indicator, an online English language test for students who are affected by the COVID-19 and are not able to attend the IELTS test centre. IELTS Indicator will assess the student's English language skills in Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. Students can take the test online from their homes. Know everything about the&nbsp;<a href="#">IELTS Indicator here</a></p>

													<h4>Why IELTS Exam is required?</h4>
													<p>IELTS 2021 exam is required for migration as well as academic purposes abroad in English speaking countries like Australia, UK, New Zealand, USA, and Canada. It is the only English Language Test approved by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) for visa applicants applying both outside and inside the UK. A lot of students get confused about why are the IELTS scores required. The simple answer to this is that foreign universities and visa granting authorities need to be sure that you will not have communication issues while staying in the country. You need to show a&nbsp;good understanding and strong command of the English language and that is why your overall IELTS scores are so important. Another common doubt students have is whether IELTS is a&nbsp;compulsory exam or not. No, IELTS isn't compulsory in all university admissions. Many universities might not even require IELTS scores for admission purposes. But remember that if you don't give IELTS, your chances of getting the student visa might suffer as the visa officers may not be convinced about your English proficiency without IELTS scores. So it is safer to appear for IELTS and aim to score at least 6 bands overall.</p>
													<p>You can take the IELTS exam with the British Council or IDP up to once a week (four times a month). The British Council and IDP global schedule for test dates&nbsp;are 48 days per year.</p>

						   <div><h4>IELTS Result</h4>
							<p dir="ltr">After you are done with your IELTS exam, your result will be available after 13 days from the test date. The result will be issued in the Test Report Form (TRF) format, and you will receive only one TRF. The TRF shows your scores in all four sections: reading, listening, writing, and speaking, along with your overall band. All five scores are given on a 9-Band scale.</p>
							<p>After the completion of your <a href="#">IELTS exam</a>, you will receive IELTS scores for each of the four sections on a band of 1 â€“ 9. Along with that, you will also get an overall band score. In this article, we will inform you of everything about the IELTS Results and scores.</p>
							<h4>How to calculate IELTS score?</h4>
							<p>To calculate your IELTS score you just need to simply take out the mean (average) of all the sections' scores, namely, Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. That is the sum of all the scores divided by four. If the average comes out in a decimal point, then it will be rounded off to the nearest half or whole band. For instance, if the average comes out in .25, then it is rounded up to the next half band. So, in this case, if your average score is 6.25, then the final score will be counted as 6.5. In other cases where the average is .75, then it will be rounded off to the next whole band. Therefore, if you get a 6.75 band, the final score will be taken as 7.</p>

						   <div><h4>IELTS Result</h4>
							<p dir="ltr">After you are done with your IELTS exam, your result will be available after 13 days from the test date. The result will be issued in the Test Report Form (TRF) format, and you will receive only one TRF. The TRF shows your scores in all four sections: reading, listening, writing, and speaking, along with your overall band. All five scores are given on a 9-Band scale.</p>
							<p>After the completion of your <a href="#">IELTS exam</a>, you will receive IELTS scores for each of the four sections on a band of 1 â€“ 9. Along with that, you will also get an overall band score. In this article, we will inform you of everything about the IELTS Results and scores.</p>
							<h4>How to calculate IELTS score?</h4>
							<p>To calculate your IELTS score you just need to simply take out the mean (average) of all the sections' scores, namely, Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. That is the sum of all the scores divided by four. If the average comes out in a decimal point, then it will be rounded off to the nearest half or whole band. For instance, if the average comes out in .25, then it is rounded up to the next half band. So, in this case, if your average score is 6.25, then the final score will be counted as 6.5. In other cases where the average is .75, then it will be rounded off to the next whole band. Therefore, if you get a 6.75 band, the final score will be taken as 7.</p>
