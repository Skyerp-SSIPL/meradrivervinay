                                          <div><h4>What is TEM Exam?</h4>
<p>TEM, Test for English Majors, is a particular EFL (English as a foreign language) test in China. It was set up by the State Education Commission in 1991, and has been organized by the Higher Education Institution Foreign Language Major Teaching Supervisory Committee since then. The test  has  been  running  for  about  20  years.  It  was  set  to  test  the  actual  performance  of Higher Education  Institution  English  Major  English  Teaching  Syllabus (Higher  Education  Institution Foreign Language Teaching Supervisory  Committee English  Group 2000).  There are two  levels in TEM, TEM 4 and TEM-8. TEM-8, Test for English Majors Band 8, is based on a higher level of standard. The object of this test is all English majors when they are in their fourth year as well as  their  last  year  in  college,  or  more  specifically,  in  their eighth  term, which  is  why the  test  is called TEM-8. It mainly tests students' ability to use English as a foreign language in addition to testing students' knowledge of words and grammar. </p>
<p>In  terms  of  measuring  students'  integrative  English  language  ability,  TEM-8  is  the  hardest  test for English  majors  in  China  (Li et  al.  2007:  78).  Every  year, hundreds  of  thousands  of  English majors  all  over  the  country  attend  the  test.  It  is  an  event  that  each  English  major  student experience before graduation.  </p>
<p>However, testing must have some kind of effect upon the process of education, especially TEM-8, which is a very important test for English majors. Here comes the term of "impact".  Wall (1997: 291) defines impact as "any of the effects that tests may have on individuals, policies or practices, within  the  classroom,  the  school,  the  educational  system,  or  society  as  a  whole".  From individuals  to  the  society,  the  impact has  a  wide  educational  context.  Previous  researches  have worked on the validity of TEM-8, the authenticity of TEM-8, but seldom the impact of TEM-8.</p>
<p>This study is to investigate the overall impact of TEM-8 on students. This is what the education department and the English majors themselves want to know more about.</p>
<img src="{{asset('public/home/images/team-test.jpg')}}">

<h4 class="mt-15">Aim</h4>
<p>This study aims to find out TEM-8's impact on English major students, in terms of their daily life,   learning process,  and future  life. Before  that, this study  first  analyzes  the  system of TEM-8  and its impact on students, including the organization of the test, the implementation of the test, and the  reform  of  the  test.  In  addition,  the  test  itself  is  also  analyzed  to  measure  whether  the  test  is suitable  for  test  takers,  mainly  focusing  on  the  usefulness  of  the  test.  There  are  six  qualities within  the  usefulness,  namely  reliability,  validity,  authenticity,  interactiveness,  impact,  and practicality.  However,  as  the  main  point  of  this  essay,  the  impact  is  especially  emphasized.  In addition to the students, the impact on teachers, education system and the society is mentioned as well.  </p>


<h4>Material  </h4>
<p>The test material used in this study consists of two parts, the test syllabus as well as a sample test paper. The  Syllabus  of  Test  for  English  Majors  Band  8 (Higher  Education  Institution  Foreign Language Teaching Supervisory Committee English Group 2005) helps to analyze the system of the test as well as its impact on students. In addition, the sample test paper of 2009 is used in this research  as  well.  The  TEM-8  test  is  extremely  well  protected  by  the  committee,  so  it  is impossible to know the content of the test of the year before or even shortly after the test. After finishing  the  scoring of  the  test  papers,  scorers  put  the  pictures  of  the  test  on  the  internet.  This year's test was taken less than two months before this study takes place, so the test has not been put  on  the  internet  yet.  However,  since  the  tests  are  similar  from  year  to  year,  thus  the  test  of 2009 is used in this research to help analyze the usefulness of the test. </p>
<p>Two  groups  of  people  are  involved  as  participants  in  this  study.  The  first  group  is  50  English major senior students of a university in China. They took the questionnaire about what they think about the test, how they prepared for the test, and how the test influences their life. Since the test is  taken  in March,  these  students have  just experienced  this year's test. Therefore,  their feelings and opinions are very important for analyzing the impact of the test on students. The other group
3 consists  of  two  English  major teachers  of  the  same  university  in  China.  The  two  teachers have been  teaching  courses  directly  related  to  the  TEM-8  for  years.  The  interviews  of  them  can directly  reflect  the  impact  of  the  test  on  the  teaching  structure,  as  well  as  teachers'  attitude towards the courses and the test.</p>

<h4>Types of TEM Exam</h4>
<p>The Pearson Language Tests – a unit of Pearson PLC Group is responsible for conducting two formats of the English proficiency test to assess the English language skills of non-native speakers of the English language.&nbsp; The two tests are TEM Academic and TEM Academic UKVI.</p>

<h4>Method  </h4>
<p>Analyzing test material is the first main research method used in this study. The Syllabus of Test for   English   Majors   Band   8 (Higher   Education   Institution   Foreign   Language   Teaching Supervisory  Committee  English  Group  2005)  includes  the  aim,  the  nature,  the  organizer,  the participants, the time, the framework, and the requirement of the test, all of which help to analyze the system of the test as well as its impact on students. In addition, the 2009 TEM-8 test paper is used in this study as well, mainly to analyze the usefulness of the test, especially the reliability of the test.</p>
<p>In  addition  to  the  test  material,  questionnaire  is  used  in  the  research  as  well  (see  Appendix  1). The questionnaire is used to find out what students think about the test, how they prepared for the test, and how the test influences their life. Questions 1 to 8 are about students' opinion about the reliability,  validity,  authenticity,  interactiveness  of  the  test.  Questions  9  to  11  investigate  how students  prepared  for  the  test.  The  rest  questions,  namely  Question  12  to  Question  16  are concerned  with  how  the  test  influences  students'  life.  The  questionnaire  was  sent  to  the participants  in  China  via  email.  After  collecting  the  feedback  from  the  students,  the  data  and information are used to investigate the impact of the test on students.</p>
<p>The  third  research  method  used  in  this  study  is  the  interviews  with  teachers  (see  Appendix  2). The interviews were also carried out via email. The two teachers who are in charge of the course answered  the  questions  about  the  settings  of  the  course,  including  the  reason  why  set  up  the course, the content of the course, and the timetable of the course. Furthermore, the teachers gave their opinions about the teaching structure and students' preparation for TEM-8. The information collected  from  the  interviews  is  used  to  analyze  test's  impact  on  teachers  as  well  as  the educational system.</p>

<h4 class="mt-15">Introduction of TEM-8</h4>
<p>According to State Education Commission's Higher Education Institution English Major English Teaching   Syllabus   (Higher   Education   Institution   Foreign   Language  Teaching   Supervisory Committee English Group 2000: 4-5 my translation), the teaching task and aim of the basic level (Grade One and Grade Two) of English major in Higher Education Institution is to  </p>
<p>In other words, the syllabus means to make the students of basic level to be competent in every respect of English learning. On the other hand, for senior grades students (Grade Three and Grade Four), the syllabus brings forward higher standard. For those students, they should go on learning basic ability of language. Meanwhile, the students should make further efforts on enlarging their scope  of   knowledge.   The   emphasis  of   this   stage   is   on  developing   students'   integrative competence  of  English,  enriching  cultural  knowledge,  and  enhancing  the  ability  of  social intercourse.</p>
<p>TEM-8  is  just  the  test  to  assess  and  evaluate  the  actual  performance  of Higher  Education Institution  English  Major  English  Teaching  Syllabus (Higher  Education  Institution  Foreign Language  Teaching  Supervisory  Committee  English  Group  2000)  for  senior  students.  In  the meantime, TEM-8  also can  assess the teaching quality as  well  as the students'  language  ability, particularly the integrative language ability and communicative ability mentioned in the syllabus that  Semester  8  students  should  have  achieved.  In  this  way,  the  test  is  able  to  promote  the implementation of the syllabus so as to improve teaching quality.</p>

<h4>The Purpose of Testing</h4>
<p>Testing is divided into different types according to different purpose. There are mainly four types of test -- proficiency tests, achievement tests, diagnostic tests, and placement tests (Hughes, 2003: 11). However, a test can also be a combination of two or more types of test such as the test being analyzed in this essay, which is a combination of proficiency and achievement test.</p>
<p>As  Hughes  (2003:  11)  states,  proficiency  tests  are  designed  to  measure  people's  ability  in  a language,  regardless  of  any  training  they  may  have  had  in  that  language.  Since  it  is  to  test whether one  is  proficient  or not,  the  content of  the  test  is not  probably  based on  the  content  or
6 objectives  of  language  courses  that  people  taking  the  test  would  have.  Proficiency  tests  test people on their command of the language for a particular purpose. They may also show whether candidates have reached  a  certain standard with  respect to  a  set  of specified abilities. However, the preparation of proficiency tests is not that easy. Test designers need to consider as objectively and  seriously  as  possible  about  the  instruction,  items,  structures,  and  other  aspects  of  the  test. Besides,  test  examiners  need  to  be  objective  in  scoring  as  well.  The  examiners  are  usually independent  of  teaching  institutions,  or  randomly  chosen  from  all  the  teaching  institutions  to make sure they can make fair comparisons between candidates from different institutions. </p>
