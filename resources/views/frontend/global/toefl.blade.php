                                                <div><h4>What is the TOEFL<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Test?</h4>
<p>TOEFL is one of the most popular English proficiency exams accepted at American and Canadian universities and schools abroad. TOEFL tests international students' usage and understanding of English as it is spoken, written and heard in college and university surroundings. ETS (Educational Testing Services) is the conducting body of the TOEFL test and is responsible for setting the TOEFL questions, conducting the test, and sending each examinee their scorecard. Students wanting to study abroad, can choose from multiple<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/toefl/important-dates" target="_blank"> TOEFL Test Dates</a> available round-the-year and select from the&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/toefl/toefl-test-centres-in-india" target="_blank">various test centres</a> located across major cities or test remotely at home with the TOEFL iBT<sup>®</sup> Special Home Edition test. Candidates looking to appear for their TOEFL exam will learn about the following TOEFL topics as they read along.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why take the TOEFL Exam?</h4>
<p>TOEFL is mostly undertaken by students who are planning to pursue higher education abroad. Appearing for TOEFL would also allow students to be eligible for several scholarships and also help students and candidates looking for employment abroad with their&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/student-visa-guide-applycontent5706" target="_blank">visa application process.</a> Accepted in over 11,000 universities and institutions worldwide, including <a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/australia/universities" target="_blank">universities in Australia</a>, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, the United States, and across Europe and Asia, TOEFL is one of the most preferred English-language tests for&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/best-country-for-studying-abroad-articlepage-1457" target="_blank">students wanting to study abroad.</a></p>
<p>Students wanting to study abroad and opting for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) comes with many benefits. TOEFL is a more preferred exam among students who want to pursue higher education abroad, as more TOEFL scores are sent to&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/usa/universities" target="_blank">universities in the United States</a> and Canada than all other English-language tests combined. Similarly, TOEFL is a more preferred English test among countries as more TOEFL scores are sent to German, French, US, and&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/canada/universities" target="_blank">Canadian universities</a> than other English tests. ETS – the conducting body of the TOEFL also guarantees students a fair and unbiased process of score reporting, making the test more authentic in nature.</p>
<p><a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/toefl/how-to-register" target="_blank">Registration for TOEFL</a>&nbsp;is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Candidates can register for their TOEFL exam via the online method, via phone or through mail or in-person (via an authorized agent). Candidates should keep in mind that TOEFL online registrations close seven days before the exam and late registration closes four days prior to the test date with a late fee of US$40. Candidates appearing for their TOEFL from India are required to pay a TOEFL registration fee of US$185.</p>


<h4>Recent Updates for TOEFL</h4>
<p>This section would cover any latest developments revolving around TOEFL for the benefit of students who are planning to appear for their TOEFL exam.</p>

<img src="{{asset('public/home/images/toefl-2.jpg')}}">

<h4 class="mt-15">ETS Launches TOEFL Essentials Test for test-takers, to be available from August 21, 2021</h4>
<p>Due to the ongoing pandemic, a lot of universities had to adopt test-optional policies or rely on substandard tests which were more affordable and convenient language tests but not necessarily of high quality nor sustainable going forward. Hence, niche English test providers,&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/toefl/essentials-test" target="_blank">ETS has launched the TOEFL Essentials test which is a higher-quality testing option in the face of the pandemic.</a></p>
<h4>Coronavirus Covid-19 TOEFL Exam Alert: TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition Test during COVID -19, Launched</h4>
<p>In response to the current pandemic COVID-19, ETS the conducting body of the TOEFL test has decided to launch the&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/toefl/benefits-of-the-toefl-ibt-special-home-edition-test-during-covid-19" target="_blank">TOEFL iBT® Special Home Edition test</a> for locations where TOEFL iBT is available for the convenience of students wanting to study abroad. The same is yet to launch in mainland China and Iran. The TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition Test was started in response to TOEFL Test Centres being temporarily shut due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, candidates need to make sure that they meet the equipment requirements set by ETS for registration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ETS has a series of webinars available on its official website that familiarizes the candidates with this new feature. The home edition of the TOEFL test would be available to students until test centers resume functioning in full capacity in the various countries. The TOEFL scores would be communicated to the student within 6-10 days. Candidates should keep in mind that due to the ongoing pandemic&nbsp;delivery of paper score reports may be delayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been a number of security measures including Artificial Intelligence technology and live proctors that have been adopted by ETS for the smooth functioning of the test at home. Accommodation for test-takers with a disability is also available to students who require the same and on request. No other major changes have been introduced by ETS for conducting the TOEFL test at home. Candidates are requested to visit the official website for a detailed understanding of the same.&nbsp;Currently, registration is open for dates from September 2020.&nbsp;ETS has also temporarily waived off&nbsp;rescheduling fees for all the test takers due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<h4>New TOEFL Exam Pattern from August 2019</h4>
<p>The Educational Testing Services (ETS) – the conducting body of TOEFL has shortened the duration of the test by 30 minutes starting August 1, 2019. The conducting body has significantly reduced the number of questions in three sections – reading, listening and speaking. The previous duration of the exam was 3 hrs and 30 minutes, the current duration of the exam is 3 hours. ETS has also introduced 'MyBest Score' – which is basically taking the candidate's best scores for each section from all valid TOEFL scores from the previous 2 years. ETS – the organizing body of the TOEFL test has rolled out&nbsp;another set of initiatives to enhance the TOEFL iBT® test experience for students. Students can now book TOEFL exam slots for afternoon testing sessions, worldwide.&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/toefl/new-toefl-exam-pattern-from-august-2019" target="_blank">For more details on the recent update, CLICK HERE&nbsp;</a></p>

<h4 class="mt-15">What are the types of TOEFL Exams?</h4>
<p>Candidates should be aware that the TOEFL test is held in two formats, viz. TOEFL iBT (Internet-based Test) and TOEFL Paper-delivered test. The TOEFL iBT is a more preferred mode of the exam and represents more than 98% of the TOEFL tests given worldwide, while the revised TOEFL Paper-delivered Test is only available in locations that do not support the use of the Internet. There is no Speaking section because of the&nbsp;technological&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;of capturing spoken responses. Read on to know more about the two formats of the TOEFL Exam.</p>
<p><strong>What is TOEFL iBT?</strong></p>
<p>As the name suggests, the TOEFL Internet-Based Test (TOEFL iBT) is the online version of the TOEFL test for candidates looking to appear for their exam. It is the more preferred medium of TOEFL due to its ease of convenience and uses fewer resources.</p>
<h4><strong>What is TOEFL Paper-delivered Test?</strong></h4>
<p>Candidates who do not have access to the TOEFL iBT test can opt for the revised TOEFL® Paper-delivered Test. The revised TOEFL® Paper-delivered Test has been made available for locations that cannot support testing via the internet. The paper test has been modeled closely with the TOEFL iBT test and requires candidates to combine their communication skills — for example, listening to a lecture, reading a passage, and then writing a response.&nbsp;&nbsp;Candidates should be aware that in this format of the TOEFL exam there is no Speaking section because of the&nbsp;technological&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;of capturing spoken responses.</p>

								<div><p>TOEFL is a language proficiency test that is given by those who want to study abroad and aspire to gain global exposure. There are no specific eligibility criteria for the TOEFL exam prescribed by the ETS, the body that conducts the TOEFL test. Majorly, it is given by students who wish to get admission to universities, colleges or educational institutions of English-speaking countries. Those who have passed out of high school or equivalent give this exam. Apart from this, candidates should hold a valid passport to present as proof of identity at the time of the exam.</p>
<p>As it is an English language proficiency test, it is always advisable for students to check the requirements of the specific college/university they are applying to. All those students whose native language is not English need to appear for this exam. The universities in major English-speaking countries like the&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/usa" target="_blank">USA</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/canada" target="_blank">Canada</a> require students to prove their language proficiency for getting admission in their educational institutions. Apart from students, professionals also <a href="https://overseaseducationlane.com/exams/toefl" target="_blank">appear for the&nbsp;TOEFL exam</a>&nbsp;as it is a requirement for getting a visa. Also, there is no age limit set by the ETS, the body that governs this exam.</p>
